WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <input_a> is placed at site <C4>. The corresponding BUFG
   component <input_a_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X2Y12>. There is
   only a select set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker buffer,
   and they are not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem exists
   and correct it. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE
   constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <input_a.PAD> allowing your design to
   continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the
   specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may
   lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition
   be corrected in the design.

      Number using O5 and O6:                   10
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     8 out of   2,278    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           19
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             3 out of      19   15%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   5 out of      19   26%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          11 out of      19   57%
    Number of unique control sets:               4
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              16 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
